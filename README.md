# Project Title

Sudoku is a SPA that generates original Sudoku boards for users to play and rank their performance. Written with 
vanilla JavaScript and focused on a central canvas, where the board graphics are drawn. A rails API generates the 
board numbers/sequence with an original algorithm, and then exposes the boards to the front end to populate the
main canvas.


## Getting Started

Our rail API is set up for PostgreSQL, so make sure to download and start a server before starting the app
locally!


### Installing

clone both front and back end repos.

back end:

$ bundle install
$ rake db:create
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake db:seed
$ rails s
